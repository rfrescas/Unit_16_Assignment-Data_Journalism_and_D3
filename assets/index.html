          <h2>Correlations Discovered Between Health Risks, Age and Income</h2>
          <p>Texas by far has the highest poverty rate compared to every other state in camparison to health care
            covered.</p>

          <p>Utah is the lowest amount of smokers than any other state. There are a larger amount of southern countries
            that are towards the top % of smokers in the country. However, West Virginia beats out all states by a small
            margin. Also, Utah is by far the youngest state with Alaska, Washington D.C., Texas and California the front
            runners.</p>

          <p>Alot of the East Coast is the highest average median household income with Hawaii being the only outlier.
            While California and New York have some of the most expensive cost of living cities and neighborhhods, its
            surprising they are not higher up on the average income. There does not seem to be strong coorelation
            between household income and any of the other categories.</p>
